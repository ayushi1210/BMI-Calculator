# BMI-Calculator
An app which calculates the BMI and gives suggestion with MVC pattern.

We have created Body Mass Index calculator.
Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many pies or if they need to eat more pies. 

Instead of taking height weight input as a traditional written input, in this UISliders are used to take inputs and multiple screens have been used to show the results with the help of classes.

Model-View-Controllers pattern has been used to make the app.

Language used - Swift
